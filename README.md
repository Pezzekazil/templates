In this repo I save pieces of working code that could be reused in multiple situations.  
For example:  
1. Charts configurations that I think I would like to use often
2. Problems like queuing systems for parallelising models
3. Different solutions to the same problem (e.g. in how many ways I can solve the Titanic problem on Kaggle)  

Please, feel free to steal ideas and code from here :).
